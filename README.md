LUMO-SQUISHO: Touch-Reactive LED Toy PCB
LUMO-SQUISHO is a custom-designed PCB for a squishy, hemispherical interactive toy that reacts to touch and hand gestures with beautiful lighting effects. The design combines capacitive touch sensing, RGB LED control, USB-C programming, rechargeable battery support, and compact integration into a single powerful platformâ€”perfect for play, mood lighting, or educational experimentation.
The PCB is built on a 4-layer stackup for improved routing, grounding, and seamless integration of densely packed components around a circular board.
